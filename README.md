# CSOC — Code–Source–Origin Cosmology

**CSOC (Code–Source–Origin Cosmology)** is a unified event-generative framework
for life, cognition, and civilization.

CSOC proposes that observable reality is not a primitive substrate,
but the accumulated result of structured information (“code”)
executed through discrete events over time.

---

## Definition

CSOC models reality as the historical accumulation of events generated
by the execution of information under governing rules.
In this framework, information precedes state,
events mediate execution,
and reality emerges as a time-integrated process.

---

## Core Contributions

1. Introduces a generative chain: **Code → Event → Reality**
2. Provides a unified event-based model of life, cognition, and civilization
3. Explains systemic instability and black-swan dynamics through
   information–rule mismatch

## Latest Release

- **CSOC v1.1 — Research Draft (2025)**
- Status: Non-metaphysical theoretical framework for academic discussion

## Research Scope

CSOC is intended as a generative layer above physics and biology,
offering a unified perspective on emergence and complexity across scales.
It is compatible with empirical investigation through
multi-agent simulation and AI world models.
