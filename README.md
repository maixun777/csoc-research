# CSOC — Code–Source–Origin Cosmology

**CSOC (Code–Source–Origin Cosmology)** is a unified event-generative framework for life, cognition, and civilization.

CSOC proposes that observable reality is not a primitive substrate, but the accumulated, emergent result of structured information (“Code”) executed through discrete events over time.

---

## Definition

CSOC models reality as the historical accumulation of events generated by the execution of information under governing rules.

In this framework:

- Information precedes state  
- Events mediate execution  
- Reality emerges as a time-integrated process  

---

## Core Contributions

1. Introduces a generative chain: **Code → Event → Reality**
2. Provides a unified event-based model of life, cognition, and civilization
3. Explains systemic instability and black-swan dynamics through **information–rule mismatch**
4. Proposes a non-metaphysical, formalizable framework compatible with complexity science and AI world models

## Research Scope

CSOC is intended as a generative layer above physics and biology, offering a unified perspective on emergence, stability, and collapse across scales.

The framework is compatible with empirical investigation through:

- Multi-agent simulation
- AI world models
- Cognitive signal processing
- Institutional and systemic evolution analysis
